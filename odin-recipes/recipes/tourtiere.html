    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Originally from my grandma's recipe box, the secret of this delectable Christmas 
        treasure is found in the ground cloves and chicken seasoning. 
        We've always made our tourtieres en grand (in large quantity), 
        as they freeze great making them a terrific quick fix throughout 
        the busy holiday season!
